# Fable Shot Detection

This webapp was built for an assigment at the [FH Kufstein](https://www.fh-kufstein.ac.at/) using [Fable](http://fable.io/), [Elmish](https://fable-elmish.github.io/) and [Suave](https://suave.io) - (heavily inspired by the [SAFE-BookStore](https://github.com/SAFE-Stack/SAFE-BookStore).

It is currently still __WIP__ and mainly a play-thing for me to learn to work with a full F# web stack (and of course how to shoehorn it into a CI/CD Azure workflow without paying a dime).

If you have any questions and/or suggestions hit me up at twitter [@GBeyerle](https://twitter.com/GBeyerle).
